It's time to stop sleeping on Michigan. When humans make the right decisions and listen to the land, there is great potential in this American wine culture we are building a decade at a time. The Simpson family of the Leelanau Peninsula, located in northern Michigan, were cherry farmers. But in the '70s, when Bruce Simpson went to study enology (the study of everything wine), that all changed. Over the years, the family has been a driving force in the development of the wine industry in the wolverine state. They listened to their land and today are making wine that needs to be talked about. This Pinot Grigio is distinctly a Michigander. It’s light and fizzy with great natural acidity. The fruit is calm and tight, bringing some mild depth. It might be one of the most refreshing Pinot Grigios around.",https://vinepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/btb-best-pinot-grigio-card-Good-Harbor-Vineyards-Pinot-Grigio.jpg,https://vinepair.com/review/good-harbor-pinot-grigio/,Pinot Gris / Grigio,

Smells like a faint whiff of caramelized pears and fancy French bistro butter. The palate has excellent balance with frothy acidity and a comfy, grippy mouthfeel. Great to just sip on its own or with some hard cheeses.",https://vinepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/btbchardonnay_giantsteps_card.jpg,https://vinepair.com/review/giant-steps-winery-chardonnay/,Chardonnay,2021-11-17
